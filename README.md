# The Journey to an Optimized Shopify Theme

This repo is a playground for experimenting with Shopify theme optimization. I'm on a mission to look for impactful yet efficient changes that will improve the Lighthouse score. This will serve as both a test bed and documentation for making improvements for Shopify themes.

Changes are documented in the docs/CHANGES.md and mention any attempts made to update the theme and how they improved the performance score.
